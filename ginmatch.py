# class to run a match of gin. a match consists of multiple GinGames, scoring as follows:
#
# win by knock: winner gets points equal to difference in deadwood held by both players
# win by gin: winner gets deadwood of loser + 25 points
# win by undercut: winner gets points equal to difference in deadwood held by both players + 25 points
#
# In the case that a player knocks or calls gin and does not have a valid knocking/gin hand, that hand
# will be exposed and visible to the opponent for the remainder of the game.
#
# once a score of 100 is reached, final scoring occurs as follows:
# - first player to 100 receives 'game bonus' of 100 points
# - both players are granted a 20 point 'line bonus' for each game won
# - totals are tallied. highest score wins.
#
# In the case that the final scores are equal, we flip a coin. In the real world, we'd want a re-match. In
# the world we're playing with here, there's a good chance we'll have identical strategies facing each other
# with an exaggerated chance of duplicate scores, leading to a good chance of infinite recursion. There will
# be other, similar if not identical strategies floating about in the population, so we can safely prune out
# ties without worrying about a large genetic penalty.
